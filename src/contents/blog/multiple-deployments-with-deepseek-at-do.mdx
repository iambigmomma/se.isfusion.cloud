# How to Deploy DeepSeek R1 on DigitalOcean: Three Approaches, Three Scenarios

This overview introduces three ways to deploy **DeepSeek R1**, a cost-effective LLM, on DigitalOcean. Each approach offers different trade-offs for **setup complexity**, **security**, **fine-tuning**, and **system-level customization**. By the end of this article, you’ll know which method aligns best with your technical skill set and your project requirements.

---

## Overview

DeepSeek R1 is a versatile LLM for generating text, answering questions, and building chat applications. On DigitalOcean, you can deploy it in three primary ways:

1. **Approach A**: **GenAI Platform (Serverless)**
2. **Approach B**: **DigitalOcean + Hugging Face Generative Service (HUGS)**
3. **Approach C**: **GPU + Ollama**

- **Approach A (GenAI Serverless)**: A convenient platform-based solution that minimizes DevOps and offers quick results, but does not support native fine-tuning.
- **Approach B (HUGS on IaaS)**: Provides a prebuilt Docker environment and API token, supports multiple containers on a GPU droplet, and lets you train or fine-tune if needed.
- **Approach C (Ollama on IaaS)**: Offers full system-level control, including custom security, OS configuration, and model fine-tuning, at the expense of higher complexity.

---

## Cost Considerations

### Approach A: GenAI Platform (Serverless)

[DigitalOcean GenAI Platform](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/genai-platform/details/pricing/#open-source-models) follows a **usage-based** pricing model:

- **Token-based** Billing: Costs accumulate for both input and output tokens, measured in per-thousand tokens and shown in per-million token rates.
- **Open-Source Models**: For example, DeepSeek-R1-distill-llama-70B is priced at **\$0.99** per million tokens (input or output). Other open-source models have different rates, starting as low as \$0.198 per million tokens.
- **Commercial Models**: If you bring your own API tokens (like Anthropic), the commercial provider’s standard rates apply.
- **Knowledge Bases (KBs)**: Additional charges apply for indexing tokens and vector storage.
- **Guardrails**: \$3.00 per million tokens if you enable jailbreaking or content moderation.
- **Functions**: Billed by [DigitalOcean Functions](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/functions/) pricing.

**Playground Limit**: The model playground is free, but limited to **10,000 tokens** per day, per team (across input and output combined).

### Approach B & C: GPU Droplets

For both **Approach B** (HUGS on IaaS) and **Approach C** (Ollama on IaaS), you will provision a GPU droplet on DigitalOcean. Check out [Announcing GPU Droplets](https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/announcing-gpu-droplets) for updated pricing. At the time of writing:

- **Starting at \$2.99/GPU/hr on-demand** (subject to change).
- Extra fees (e.g., egress, storage) may apply for certain workloads.
- You maintain your own OS-level security, scaling, and patching.

---

## Security and Maintenance

- **Approach A (GenAI Serverless)**:

  - Security patches and maintenance are automatic.
  - You can optionally use guardrails or knowledge bases, billed by token usage.

- **Approach B (HUGS)**:

  - You manage the GPU droplet’s OS, Docker environment, and any firewall rules.
  - A default token-based authentication is provided for the LLM endpoint.

- **Approach C (Ollama)**:
  - Highest control and responsibility. You secure the OS, implement your own firewall and usage monitoring.
  - Ideal for strict compliance or advanced custom requirements, but more DevOps work.

> **Performance Benchmarks?**  
> We do not currently publish official metrics or SLAs for model speed. Actual performance depends on GPU size, data volume, and workload specifics. If you need help optimizing performance, feel free to contact our solution architects. We may also share future content on benchmarking techniques.

---

## Approach A: GenAI Platform (Serverless)

Use **Approach A** if you want a fully managed environment for DeepSeek R1 without GPU provisioning or OS-level tasks. You can quickly spin up a chatbot, Q&A flow, or basic RAG features through a user-friendly interface.

### When to Choose Approach A

- You have minimal DevOps expertise or do not want to manage servers at all.
- You need a fast way to launch an AI assistant (e.g., a WordPress site plugin or FAQ bot).
- You do **not** plan to train or fine-tune the model on private data.

### Example Scenario: Chelsea’s Local Café Blog

![chelsea](https://res.cloudinary.com/iambigmomma/image/upload/v1739273832/blog/deepseek-deploy-3-ways/chelsea-case.jpg)

Chelsea runs a WordPress blog for her local café, featuring regular menu updates and community event postings. She’s experienced in basic site hosting but **not** server administration:

- She wants an AI chatbot to answer visitor questions about opening hours, special dishes, or community gatherings.
- She may consider adding **guardrails** later if she sees inappropriate content attempts.
- The GenAI Platform requires virtually no server management, so it’s perfect for her.

#### Not Ideal If…

- You need **fine-tuning** or custom domain training.
- You have stringent security mandates (custom OS rules, private networking).
- You want to host multiple microservices or run more sophisticated tasks on one server.

---

## Approach B: DigitalOcean + Hugging Face Generative Service (HUGS)

Approach B is for developers who want to spin up a GPU droplet with **HUGS** to leverage Hugging Face tooling, partial sysadmin freedoms (multi-container setup), and a straightforward **API token** mechanism. It also supports training or fine-tuning on the GPU droplet.

### When to Choose Approach B

- You need a faster path to a secure AI endpoint than a fully manual approach.
- You plan to do some training or **fine-tuning** on the same GPU droplet.
- You’re comfortable with Docker fundamentals and partial server administration.

### Example Scenario: CHFB Labs

![CHFB](https://res.cloudinary.com/iambigmomma/image/upload/v1739273832/blog/deepseek-deploy-3-ways/chfb-case.jpg)

Paul’s agency builds quick Proofs of Concept for clients:

- Some clients request domain-specific training or partial fine-tuning.
- He can run additional Docker containers (e.g., a staging website or a logging service) on the same droplet.
- A default **access token** is built in for the LLM endpoint, eliminating the need for custom auth code.

#### Not Ideal If…

- You want a totally **serverless** approach (Approach A is simpler).
- You require specialized OS-level modifications (like custom kernel modules).
- You prefer a fully manual pipeline with no preconfigured environment constraints.

---

## Approach C: GPU + Ollama

Choose **Approach C** if you want maximum control over your GPU droplet. You can configure OS-level security, run custom domain training, and build your own endpoints. This approach also imposes the highest DevOps burden.

### When to Choose Approach C

- You plan to manage the OS, Docker, or orchestrators manually.
- You need tight compliance or specialized environment rules (firewalls, advanced networking).
- You want to **fine-tune** DeepSeek R1 or run large-scale, resource-intensive tasks.

### Example Scenario: Mosaic Solutions

![mosaic](https://res.cloudinary.com/iambigmomma/image/upload/v1739273832/blog/deepseek-deploy-3-ways/mosaic-case.jpg)

Mosaic Solutions handles advanced analytics pipelines for enterprise clients:

- They store sensitive user data and require custom encryption or specialized frameworks.
- They prefer to install [Ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama) directly, controlling how the model is exposed to internal or external users.
- OS-level monitoring, usage logs, and performance tuning are fully under their control.

#### Not Ideal If…

- You dislike DevOps tasks or lack OS-level security expertise.
- You need a one-click or minimal-effort deployment.
- You only need a small chatbot with low-volume usage.
