## What is NVIDIA Dynamo? Understanding LLM Inference Frameworks with a Michelin Restaurant Analogy

Imagine walking into a Michelin-starred restaurant. It's not just about having top-tier chefs (like vLLM, a high-performance inference engine), but also having a complete professional service system, ordering system, customized menu design, and even the ability to coordinate the optimal serving sequence and experience based on each customer's taste preferences, allergies, and dining timing.
![dynamo_components](https://res.cloudinary.com/iambigmomma/image/upload/v1749459375/blog/nvidia-dynamo-digitalocean-tutorial/dynamo_components.jpeg)

- **vLLM** is like the top-tier kitchen engine in the restaurant, capable of quickly and efficiently preparing various dishes, ensuring each dish is delicious.
- **NVIDIA Dynamo** is like the entire Michelin restaurant's operational system. It not only includes kitchens like vLLM, but also front-desk ordering, customer preference management, dish routing, and serving coordination functions. Dynamo can arrange the most suitable chef based on each customer's needs, adjust menu details, and ensure multiple dishes can be served simultaneously and on time.

In the world of LLM inference, what does this mean?

- **Pre-fill** (context understanding) is like the restaurant preparing suitable ingredients and seasonings based on customers' past dining records and taste preferences.
- **Decode** (generating responses) is like the head chef cooking dishes exclusively for you based on this information.
- **Dynamo** coordinates the entire process, allowing each GPU (chef) to perform at maximum efficiency and automatically allocate resources based on different requests, ensuring each customer can enjoy their meal at the optimal time.

**Summary:**  
Dynamo is not meant to replace vLLM, but to incorporate efficient kitchens like vLLM into a smarter, more flexible operational system. This allows AI services to simultaneously handle more users, support larger models, and provide higher quality experiences.
