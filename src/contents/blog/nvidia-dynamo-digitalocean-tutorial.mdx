## What is NVIDIA Dynamo? Understanding LLM Inference Frameworks with a Michelin Restaurant Analogy

Imagine walking into a Michelin-starred restaurant. It's not just about having top-tier chefs (like vLLM, a high-performance inference engine), but also having a complete professional service system, ordering system, customized menu design, and even the ability to coordinate the optimal serving sequence and experience based on each customer's taste preferences, allergies, and dining timing.
![dynamo_components](https://res.cloudinary.com/iambigmomma/image/upload/v1749459375/blog/nvidia-dynamo-digitalocean-tutorial/dynamo_components.jpeg)

- **vLLM** is like the top-tier kitchen engine in the restaurant, capable of quickly and efficiently preparing various dishes, ensuring each dish is delicious.
- **NVIDIA Dynamo** is like the entire Michelin restaurant's operational system. It not only includes kitchens like vLLM, but also front-desk ordering, customer preference management, dish routing, and serving coordination functions. Dynamo can arrange the most suitable chef based on each customer's needs, adjust menu details, and ensure multiple dishes can be served simultaneously and on time.

In the world of LLM inference, what does this mean?

- **Pre-fill** (context understanding) is like the restaurant preparing suitable ingredients and seasonings based on customers' past dining records and taste preferences.
- **Decode** (generating responses) is like the head chef cooking dishes exclusively for you based on this information.
- **Dynamo** coordinates the entire process, allowing each GPU (chef) to perform at maximum efficiency and automatically allocate resources based on different requests, ensuring each customer can enjoy their meal at the optimal time.

**Summary:**  
Dynamo is not meant to replace vLLM, but to incorporate efficient kitchens like vLLM into a smarter, more flexible operational system. This allows AI services to simultaneously handle more users, support larger models, and provide higher quality experiences.

sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-$VERSION_CODENAME}") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin -y
sudo systemctl restart docker
# Test
sudo docker run hello-world
```

## Step 6: Install doctl and Login to DigitalOcean

> Why: doctl can manage DOCR, pushing images to cloud repository.

```bash
sudo snap install doctl

doctl auth init
# If encountering permission denied, create config directory first:
sudo mkdir -p /root/.config
# Apply for a DO API token, then execute again:
doctl auth init
# Enter token
# Test if successful
doctl registry repo list
# If encountering permission issues
sudo snap connect doctl:dot-docker
doctl registry login
```

## Step 7: Set Up Python Virtual Environment and Install Dynamo

> Why: Using virtual environment avoids package conflicts, ensuring clean Dynamo installation.

```bash
apt-get update
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -yq python3-dev python3-pip python3-venv libucx0
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip install "ai-dynamo[all]"
```

## Step 8: Download Dynamo Source Code

> Why: Self-built images ensure environment consistency, pushing to DOCR facilitates team collaboration and automation.

```bash
./container/build.sh
# Wait 20-30 minutes

export DOCKER_REGISTRY=<your-registry>
docker tag dynamo:v0.3.0-vllm $DOCKER_REGISTRY/dynamo-base:v0.3.0-vllm
docker login $DOCKER_REGISTRY
docker push $DOCKER_REGISTRY/dynamo-base:v0.3.0-vllm
# Wait 20-30 minutes
```

## Step 10: Start Dynamo Distributed Runtime Services

> Why: Start Dynamo distributed runtime services to provide infrastructure support for subsequent inference services.

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/metrics/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

## Step 11: Enter Container and Mount Workspace

> Why: Developing inside containers avoids host environment pollution, ensuring dependency consistency.

```bash
./container/run.sh -it --mount-workspace --image dynamo:v0.3.0-vllm
```

![container_workspace](https://res.cloudinary.com/iambigmomma/image/upload/v1749459375/blog/nvidia-dynamo-digitalocean-tutorial/container_workspace.png)

## Step 12: Rust Project Build and CLI File Preparation

> Why: Build Rust project first and prepare CLI tools for subsequent testing.

```bash
cargo build --release
mkdir -p /workspace/deploy/dynamo/sdk/src/dynamo/sdk/cli/bin
cp /workspace/target/release/http /workspace/deploy/dynamo/sdk/src/dynamo/sdk/cli/bin
cp /workspace/target/release/llmctl /workspace/deploy/dynamo/sdk/src/dynamo/sdk/cli/bin
cp /workspace/target/release/dynamo-run /workspace/deploy/dynamo/sdk/src/dynamo/sdk/cli/bin

# Wait 10-15 minutes
```

## Step 13: Python Package Installation

> Why: Install Python packages to start Dynamo services.

```bash
uv pip install -e .
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/workspace/deploy/sdk/src:/workspace/components/planner/src
```

## Step 14: Start Dynamo Test Service

> Why: Start service to validate LLM inference performance.

```bash
cd examples/llm
dynamo serve graphs.agg_router:Frontend -f configs/agg_router.yaml
```

- If encountering 429 (Too many requests) during model download, please wait five minutes and retry.

![dynamo_serve](https://res.cloudinary.com/iambigmomma/image/upload/v1749459375/blog/nvidia-dynamo-digitalocean-tutorial/dynamo_serve.png)

## Step 15: Send Test Request
